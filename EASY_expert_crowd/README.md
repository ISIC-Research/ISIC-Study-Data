# EASY (248 images) expert responses data
The data in the CSV files in this folder relates to the
[EASY Dermoscopy Expert Agreement Study](https://api.isic-archive.com/collections/166/) images.

## Study design
The data for this study was collected on Centaur Labs' [DiagnosUs platform](https://www.diagnosus.com).
For each of the 248 images, experts were asked to decide whether the
following (higher-level) feature was present in within the lesion area:

- Dots
- Globules
- Lines
- Network
- Regression structures
- Vessels

## CSV files (split by feature)
Due to the nature of "contests" run on the platform, each feature was
implemented as a separate contest:

- ``Dots_248easy_experts_responses.csv`` - expert opinions on Dots
- ``Globules_248easy_experts_responses.csv`` - expert opinions on Globules
- ``Lines_248easy_experts_responses.csv`` - expert opinions on Lines
- ``Network_248easy_experts_responses.csv`` - expert opinions on Network
- ``Regression_248easy_experts_responses.csv`` - expert opinions on Regression structures
